"""
This module provides a function to divide all elements of a matrix by a
given number.

The function `matrix_divided` takes a matrix (a list of lists of integers
or floats) and divides each element by a specified divisor. The result is
a new matrix where each element is rounded to 2 decimal places.

Functions:
- matrix_divided(matrix, div): Divides all elements of the matrix by the
  divisor and returns a new matrix.

Exceptions:
- TypeError: Raised if the matrix is not a list of lists of integers or
  floats, or if the divisor is not a number.
- ZeroDivisionError: Raised if the divisor is zero.

def matrix_divided(matrix, div):

    Divides all elements of a matrix by a given number
    and rounds the result to 2 decimal places.

    Parameters:
    matrix (list of lists of int/float): The matrix to be divided.
    div (int/float): The divisor for the division.

    Returns:
    list of lists of float: A new matrix with all elements divided by div,
    rounded to 2 decimal places.

    Raises:
    TypeError: If matrix is not a list of lists of integers/floats.
    TypeError: If any row of the matrix is not the same size.
    TypeError: If div is not a number.
    ZeroDivisionError: If div is zero.
